        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h3>In today's digital landscape, the concepts of edge computing and cloud computing are becoming increasingly prevalent. Both technologies are designed to process and store data, but they do so in fundamentally different ways. Understanding these differences is crucial for developers and businesses aiming to optimize their IT infrastructure and deliver better services.</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
        <h2>Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, allowing users to access and store data on remote servers rather than on local machines. It provides a wide range of services, including:</h2>
        <h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</h3>
        <h4>Virtualized computing resources over the internet.</h4>
        <h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</h3>
        <h4>Platforms allowing developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.</h4>
        <h3>Software as a Service (SaaS):</h3>
        <h4>Software applications delivered over the internet on a subscription basis.</h4>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>Advantages of Cloud Computing</h1>
        <h2>1) Scalability:</h2>
        <h3>Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.</h3>
        <h2>2) Cost-Effectiveness:</h2>
        <h3>Pay-as-you-go pricing models reduce upfront costs.</h3>
        <h2>3) Accessibility:</h2>
        <h3>Access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>What is Edge Computing?</h1>
        <h2>Edge computing is a decentralized computing model that brings computation and data storage closer to the source of data generation. Instead of relying solely on a centralized cloud server, edge computing processes data locally on devices such as IoT sensors, gateways, or edge servers.</h2>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>Advantages of Edge Computing</h1>
        <h2>1) Reduced Latency:</h2>
        <h3>Processing data closer to the source results in faster response times, which is critical for real-time applications.</h3>
        <h2>2) Bandwidth Efficiency:</h2>
        <h3>Reduces the amount of data transmitted to the cloud, saving bandwidth and minimizing costs.</h3>
        <h2>3) Enhanced Privacy and Security:</h2>
        <h3>Sensitive data can be processed locally, reducing exposure to potential breaches during transmission.</h3>
      </div>

        <h1>When to Use Each Technology</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Use Cloud Computing when you need powerful computing resources, extensive storage, and when latency is not a critical concern. It's ideal for applications like data analytics, machine learning, and backup solutions.</li>
          <li>Use Edge Computing when real-time processing, low latency, and bandwidth efficiency are critical. This is especially relevant for IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, and smart manufacturing.</li>
        </ul>
